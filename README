Fork of TinyScheme, with additional features.

This fork features a foreign function interface and a new cell type called
foreign-pointer, which has a special, user-defined finalizer function that is
invoked when the cell is collected, thus allowing for the proper release of
resources.
Also, each foreign pointer has a user-defined tag field, which allows run-time
identification of the resources owned.

Together, these features facilitate the use of existing native libraries, by
making easier the wrapping of opaque data types and the integration of native
functions.

The original TinyScheme, by Dimitrios Souflis and Jonathan S. Shapiro is at
http://tinyscheme.sourceforge.net/.
