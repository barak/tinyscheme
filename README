Subversion fork of TinyScheme, by Dimitrios Souflis and Jonathan S. Shapiro.

Quoted from the site:
TinyScheme is a lightweight Scheme interpreter that implements as large a subset
of R5RS as was possible without getting very large and complicated. It is meant
to be used as an embedded scripting interpreter for other programs. As such, it
does not offer IDEs or extensive toolkits although it does sport a small
top-level loop, included conditionally. A lot of functionality in TinyScheme is
included conditionally, to allow developers freedom in balancing features and
footprint.
